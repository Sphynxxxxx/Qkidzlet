                <p>Addition Concepts</p><br><br><br>
                Learning Targets: <br><br><br>
                •Illustrates addition as “putting together, combining, or joining sets”. <br><br>
                We use addition to combine sets. <br>
                For example: <br><br>
                <div class ="Example">6 + 3 = 9</div><br><br>
                The symbol (=) means “equal to”. <br><br>
                The “plus” (+) sign is part of an addition sentence that means “to add to”. <br><br>
                The “sum” is the answer to an addition sentence. <br><br>
                The numbers in our sentence have names. <br><br>
                <div class ="Example">6 and 3 are called the “addends”<br><br>9 is called the “sum”</div> <br><br>
                Remember: <br><br><br>
                •Addition is about putting sets together or putting more. <br><br>
                •Addends are more numbers added. <br><br>
                •Sum is the answer in addition. <br><br><br><hr><br><br>
                <p>Subtraction Concepts</p><br><br><br>
                Learning Targets: <br><br>
                •Illustrates subtraction as “taking away” or “comparing” elements of sets. <br><br>
                •Illustrates that addition and subtraction are inverse operations. <br><br>
                When we subtract, we “take away”. For example: <br><br><br>
                <div class ="Example">7 - 4 = 3</div><br><br>
                We can also think of subtraction as comparing elements of the given sets. <br><br>
                Minus (-) sign is part of the subtraction sentence that means “to take from”. <br><br>
                The symbol that we use for subtraction is minus or “-”. <br><br>
                <div class ="Example">7 is called the “minuend and 4 is the “subtrahend”<br><br> 3 is called the “difference”</div> <br><br>
                Remember: <br><br><br>
                Subtraction is: <br><br>
                •taking away elements of sets;<br>
                •comparing sets; and <br>
                •the opposite of addition. <br><br><br>
