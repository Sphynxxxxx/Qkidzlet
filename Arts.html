            <p> Different Shapes and Color</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <div class="begin">
                The things around you have characteristics. Characteristic is the quality you used to describe a person or an object. If a boy is tall, being tall is his characteristic. If a ruler is long, being long is its characteristics. <br><br>
                One characteristic of objects is their color. You use your eyes to describe colors. Look at these pictures. <br><br>

                Another characteristic of objects is their shape. Some objects are round. Others are triangle, square, or rectangle. Recall how each shape looks. <br><br>

                <div class="second">Different Tastes and Textures</div><br>
                Objects do not only have color and shape. They also have different tastes and textures. You can tell the taste of an object using your tongue. There are some objects that taste sweet. Some taste sour, salty, or bitter. Most of the objects that we taste are the ones that we eat. Look at the examples here.  <br><br><br>

                You use your skin to feel the texture of an object. An object's texture can be described as soft or hard. It can also be smooth or rough. Take these for example. <br><br><br>
